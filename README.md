# star map

my attempt to create an "interactive" map using matplotlib to visualise stars, constellation, position of the sun, local meridian and local horizon. data is taken from:

- the [gaiadr3](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr3) dataset
- [d3-celestial](https://github.com/ofrohn/ofrohn.github.io) by olaf frohn (bsd 3-clause license)

heres a shady gif:

the whole purpose of this was for me to learn to read such maps. nothing else. do with it what you want.
